Segway Simulation 

## Description
 the project is a simulation of a desgined Model  and maintaining his  Speed  and Balance using a Segway   while going through  different Obstacles  using PID Controller 
 the Model and the Segway were both designed in Blender ("https://www.blender.org/")
 the simulation of the Model was in Mujoco: ("https://mujoco.org/")

PID-Controller  : see pid_eng-1.pdf file 




## Visuals
Segway_PID.mp4 shows the final result 


### Dependencies

Jupyter notebooks via the "Physx HCI 2" kernel
MuJoCo


## Installation
Note: please make sure that all stl files(.stl) and (.obj) are in the same folder otherwise you will get an error while running the designated file ( check Segway_v5.zip)


Download Segway_v5.zip in elearning
Unzip Segway_v5.zip


### Executing program
MUJOCO
1. download the .zip file 
2. download the mujoco simulate 
3. drag the .xml file to the centre of mujoco simulate
4. make sure that .obj, .stl, .xml renderer.py files are in a same folder

Jupyter notebook:
1. Upload all files under the .zip file to JupterLab.
2. Open the Segway-v5.ipynb file.
3. Set Kernel to Physx HCI 2 to ensure that all dependent libraries are in the environment.
4. Click: Kernel - Restart Kernel and Run all Cells.
